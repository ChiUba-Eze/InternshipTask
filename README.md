# Pre-InternshipTask
This repo is a test on my basic knowledge on HTML, doing a project on what I have learnt up 
until now in the current ongoing pre-internship program at HNG, using my CV(Curriculum Vitae)
as a Hands-On task.
Subsequent updates will be added to this project as I advance in my learning process.
